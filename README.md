This is my discord bot

How to use the bot:

Using the bot: If you would like to use my bot for your own server, just use the following link to invite the bot to it: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1392842869634764902&permissions=268438528&integration_type=0&scope=bot,

 It is worth mentioning that the code for the welcome message I have made channel-specific to suit my needs. Therefore, if you would like to use the welcome message feature of the bot yourself, you will have to use this code to create your own bot. Therefore, make sure you change the channel ID and the role you would like to give in Booker+Welcomer.py Additionally, make sure you put your own bot's token in a system environmental variable.
